Things To Do:

1.Initialize the Pygame library.
  Create a window to represent the pool table.


2.Draw the pool table background.
  Represent the pool table boundaries.


3.Define the ball object with attributes like position, velocity, and radius.
3.1.Implement basic physics for ball movement, including collision detection.
3.2.Handle friction and ball deceleration over time.


4.Allow user input to control the direction and power of the cue stick.
4.1.Translate user input into a force applied to the cue ball.


5.Implement collision detection and response between balls and with the walls.


6.Implement a scoring system for keeping track of points.
  Decide how the game will be won or lost.


7.Implement a game loop to continuously update the game state and handle user input.


8.Test the game thoroughly to identify and fix bugs.
  Ensure that the physics and collisions behave as expected.

Polishing:

Add graphics for the pool balls and cue stick.
Animate the balls' movement and collisions.
Add any additional features or refinements to enhance the user experience.
Optimize code and improve performance if necessary.
